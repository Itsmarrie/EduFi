        <h3>Investing</h3>
        <p>Investing can potentially be very beneficial. You can start your investment journey by buying a small number of stocks and/or fractional shares. If you are below the age of 18 you cannot open your personal brokerage account for buying stocks, but you can open a custodial account operated by your guardian or parent. It requires a lot of time and effort but the results can be rewarding. By investing long-term rather than short-term, your chances of success increase.

        <h3>Budgeting</h3>
        <p>Budgeting allows you to track your spending and manage your money. If teens have good financial habits, when they are older they will be financially responsible adults. You have to find out what your source of income is and your expenses. You also have to consider some of the income as savings and emergency funds. You could also consider donating to charity and volunteer work.

        <h3>Saving</h3>
        <p>A savings account is a safe way to store your emergency funds. Though you are limited to some things like debit cards, online bill pay, and unlimited atm withdrawals and online transfers. The interest you receive is less than the amount you would get when using an investment account, but your money has no risk of being lost.

        <h3>Debt</h3>
        <p>A budget deficit is when the government spends more than it brings in tax revenue in a year.  Then it has to borrow money to cover the year's shortfall. Debt is the accumulation of budget deficits. Another form of debt is the amount of money you owe someone. For example, if your mom gives you $20 to spend at the store and you spend $30 you owe your mom $10.

        <p>We’ve all most likely heard the term “budget”. However, I myself used to think that this was just  a boring finance tool for middle-aged people. Why is it relevant to me as a young adult and what really is a budget? <br><br>

Let’s start off with what a budget actually is. Budgeting is the process of taking your income and making a plan to consume a certain percentage of this income on different categories of spending. This may not be making total sense yet, but let’s move into the main categories of spending for some clarity.<br><br>

A large portion of many people’s budget is made up of expenses or “needs”. These are essential items that we need to pay for for our survival. Some examples of expenses are groceries, transportation, utilities, etc. Once those are paid for every month, we’re left with disposable income. This is where it gets fun.<br><br>

Disposable income can be used to pay for nonessential items. These could include subscription services like netflix or spotify, shopping, eating out, donating, and more. This is where you can let your creativity flow and really customize your budget to what you want to spend your money on. <br><br>

It’s also important to make sure that you are allocating a portion of your budget to saving & investing. These are financial concepts that are explained in other articles, but needless to say, setting aside money for your future is important at any age.

So, how do you go about creating this budget? We’ve linked a template down below to help you create your own budget! Good luck from the Edufi team!
